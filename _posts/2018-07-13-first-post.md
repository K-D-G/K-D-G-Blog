Python is a great programming language to learn and is one of the most used languages used today for many tasks such as machine learning and data science. However, many people have now decided to use Python as a tool for serving websites with the help of frameworks such as: Django and Flask. Although Python is a good programming language; should it be used on the web?

On one hand it should. This is becuase it has simple and easy to understand syntax so is great for small business and hobbyists to use. The frameworks are easy to use as Flask is simple for the beginner with only a few advanced concepts used such as decorators (mainly @app.route('/')). Django is more complex as you are forced to split the website up into micro services and you have to rely on API's for your site to work. Flask doesn't force you to do this; so a great bonus. Also if a person decides to use python they do not have ot know what types to use for the variables as python already knows this. Overall it is great for the beginner.

For well experienced programmers it is not a good tool. This is because other languages like go run quicker than python and having to sacrifice a bit of time to decide the type of a variable is sufficient; most programmers can decide the type of a variable intuitively therefore it doesn't matter. Another point to consider is that the top companies like google (ok they developed go but so what) and facebook do not use python for web hosting as they probably use a faster language such as go or even try with C and C++ just for the speed. C and C++ maybe difficult to use for web hosting becuase they are very complex and can cause alot of headaches at times when debugging. From my point of view as a programmer I would use the faster language as it can keep up to demands of users and is overall efficient.

Even though python is a good language and I am slightly biased since it is one of my favourite languages I would not use it for websites. It is just to slow with having to be interpreted every second whereas compiled languages are faster since they do not need an interpreter to translate them.
